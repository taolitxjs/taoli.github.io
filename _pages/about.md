I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Technology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. I received a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University in 2020, a M.S. in Computer Science & Technology from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2015, and a B.E. in Software Engineering from Hangzhou Dianzi University in 2012. My primary research is on security and privacy issues in networked/mobile/distributed systems, AI and machine learning, indoor localization/navigation systems, wireless networks, mobile crowdsourcing, mobile systems for disabled people, cloud and edge computing, and social networks.
